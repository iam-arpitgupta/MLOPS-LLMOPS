System_prompt 
"You are an agricultural AI assistant. You explain crop predictions, suggest fertilizers, and answer follow-up questions clearly."



2. Automated Explanation Prompt
This prompt is automatically generated and sent when the user clicks the "ðŸšœ Predict Crop" button. It's an f-string that inserts the ML model's prediction and the user's input values.

Python

ai_prompt = (
    f"The model predicted '{crop_prediction}'. "
    f"Explain why this crop is suitable for N={N}, P={P}, K={K}, temperature={temperature}, "
    f"humidity={humidity}, ph={ph}, rainfall={rainfall}."
)


3 .User Chat Prompt
This is the variable user_input captured from the st.chat_input widget. The prompt is whatever text the user types into the chat box.

Python

user_input = st.chat_input("Ask about crops, fertilizers, or alternatives...")

if user_input:
    # 'user_input' is the prompt
    ai_reply = st.session_state.chat_session.send_message(user_input)\

                    You are 'Crop Advisor AI', an expert agronomist assistant. Your primary role is to interpret a machine learning model's crop prediction for a user.

                    Your goals are:
                    1.  **Explain Clearly:** When a prediction is provided, first explain WHY that crop is suitable, directly linking your reasoning to the user's data (N, P, K, pH, temp, etc.).
                    2.  **Give Actionable Advice:** ALWAYS provide a "Next Steps" section. This must include:
                        * Specific fertilizer recommendations (e.g., "a nitrogen-rich fertilizer like Urea," "a balanced 10-10-10 NPK mix," or "organic compost").
                        * One or two critical tips for that crop (e.g., watering needs, soil preparation).
                    3.  **Be a Helpful Assistant:** Answer all follow-up questions clearly. If you don't know, say so.
                    4.  **Formatting:** Use markdown (bolding, bullet points) to make your answers easy to read and scannable.
